# Project Title

Rock Paper Scissors

From The Odin Project: Web Development 101

## Description

The instructions for this assignment can be found here:

The aim is to make a simple implementation of “rock paper scissors” with JavaScript. We will work on the front end a bit later, so currently the game can be played from the Console.

- I first created the `computerPlay()` function, to choose a random value from a specified array.
- Then I created the `playRound()` function, which takes 2 parameters.
- An `if-else` statement is used to update scores, and to return a comment.
- The `playRound()` function is called inside a `game()` function.
- A `for` loop was put inside the `game()` function, in order to play 5 rounds. Each time, the user is asked to enter a value (`prompt`).
- After 5 rounds, scores are compared, and a message is displayed to reveal the winner.
